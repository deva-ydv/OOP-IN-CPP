All 4 pillars of OOP in C++:

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
   
Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This repository contains my learning journey of OOP in C++.
I have practiced and implemented all the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming:
Classes & Objects – Creating blueprints and instances.

1. Encapsulation – Binding data and methods together with restricted access.
2. Inheritance – Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
3. Polymorphism – Using one function or method in many forms.
4. Abstraction – Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

OOP makes C++ more powerful, modular, and easier to maintain.
This repo serves as my notes and practice examples for mastering OOP.
